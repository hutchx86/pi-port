# Pi Port -- a DIY UniFi Protect "AI Port" on Orange Pi 5 Plus / RK3588

`piport` emulates a **UniFi Protect AI Port** on an RK3588 board (Orange Pi 5 Plus): sysid
`0xa5f1`, catalog platform string `"UVC AI Port"`. It answers the real discovery, adoption, and
camera protocols well enough for a Protect console to adopt it and pair real cameras to it, and
runs real object detection on the RK3588 NPU. It is an interoperability proof of concept, **not a
product** and **not affiliated with or endorsed by Ubiquiti**. See "Scope and legal" below.

## Wire protocol (confirmed)

The AI Port shares firmware middleware with real UniFi cameras (`ubnt_ctlserver`,
`ubnt_avclient`), so its protocol is the known camera/chime protocol plus AI-Port-specific
additions. All of the following was confirmed live against a real console.

1. **UDP/10001 discovery** -- classic UBNT L2 discovery. The `platform` TLV (`0x0C`) must
   equal the controller's catalog string `"UVC AI Port"`; sysid is `0xa5f1`.
2. **HTTPS control API on the device, port 443** (the shared camera firmware's
   `ubnt_ctlserver`, not AI Key's bespoke 8080):

   | Method | Path                | Purpose |
   |--------|---------------------|---------|
   | POST   | `/api/1.2/manage`   | Adopt endpoint. Nested body: `{"username","password","mgmt":{"username","password","hosts","token","protocol","mode","nvr","controller","consoleId","consoleName"}}`. |
   | POST   | `/api/1.2/login`    | Controller logs in first (any `Set-Cookie` accepted) before most `api/1.2/<action>` calls. |
   | GET    | `/api/1.2/status`   | `{fw, board:{hwaddr}, features:{...}}`. A camera capability endpoint; not the AI Port capability mechanism (step 4). |
   | POST   | `/api/1.2/snapshot` | Still image. |

3. **Outbound mTLS WebSocket -- `ucp4` binary envelope**, to `<console-ip>:7442` (8-byte
   header + JSON envelope, as chime/AI Key). Handles adoption bookkeeping and generic RPCs
   (`getInfo`, `networkStatus`, `sshService`). It does **not** carry camera commands:
   `registerDeviceWebSocket` only adds a connection to the camera-command routing pool for
   connections that do **not** negotiate `ucp4`, which is why pairing needs a second
   connection.
4. **Outbound mTLS WebSocket -- the classic pre-`ucp4` avclient protocol**, same URL/port,
   headers `camera-mac`/`camera-model` (`camera-model` is the literal sysid string `"0xa5f1"`,
   not `"UVC AI Port"`), subprotocol `secure_transfer`. **Wire format is plain JSON in BINARY
   WebSocket frames** (not text). This connection carries:
   - `UiStreamControl` -- pairing/streaming control. Reply must be
     `{"status":"started"|"stopped","usedPoints":N}`; `usedPoints` MUST be on every reply
     (start **and** stop) or the controller's capacity bookkeeping breaks after repeated
     pair/unpair cycles.
   - `EventSmartDetect` -- device-to-controller detection push. Top-level `descriptors` array
     (not `tracks`); each has `objectType`, `coord: [x,y,w,h]` (flat array), `trackerID`,
     `confidenceLevel`. Top-level `edgeType` is a per-track state machine: `"enter"` opens a
     dashboard event, `"moving"` updates it, `"leave"` closes it and triggers a thumbnail
     upload. **`"none"` alone opens nothing.**
   - `EventFeatureFlagsUpdated` -- device-to-controller capability push; the real mechanism
     behind `featureFlags.smartDetectTypes` / `hasMotionDetection` (see "Object detection").
   - `GetRequest` (`what: "snapshot"` or `"smartDetectZoneSnapshot"`) -- asks for a JPEG,
     uploaded as `multipart/form-data` to the request's `uri`.

## Components

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `config.py` + `aiport.cfg` | Shared configuration and device-identity loader. All stages read the same file; CLI flags override cfg. |
| `discovery.py` | UDP/10001 discovery responder, `platform="UVC AI Port"`, `sysid=0xa5f1`. |
| `http_api.py` | HTTPS `:443`: `/api/1.2/manage`, `/api/1.2/login`, `/api/1.2/status`, `/api/1.2/snapshot`. |
| `ucp4_client.py` | Generic `ucp4` device-management WebSocket client (adoption, `getInfo`). |
| `avclient.py` | Classic per-camera avclient client: pairing, detection/classification, `EventSmartDetect` / `EventFeatureFlagsUpdated` pushes, snapshot upload. Most real behavior lives here. |
| `detector.py` | Wraps `RKNNLite` running a quantized YOLOv5s model on the RK3588 NPU. |
| `run_all.py` | Launches all of the above together. |
| `sysinfo_server.py` | Board system monitor / multi-instance web UI (CPU, memory, GPU, NPU); not part of the protocol. |
| `instance_manager.py` | Manages multiple reboot-surviving emulator instances as systemd units (macvlan or physical). |

## Configuration (`aiport.cfg`)

Identity, networking, and the console endpoint live in `aiport.cfg` (INI) next to `run_all.py`,
loaded via `config.py`. Every stage reads the same file, and any CLI flag overrides the cfg
value. The protocol scripts also accept `--config <path>` and `--debug`; `run_all.py` passes both through
to its children. Only full-line `#` comments are supported (`configparser` ignores inline ones).

```ini
[identity]
mac =
hostname = piport
platform = UVC AI Port
sysid = 0xa5f1
fw_version = 5.1.12.67
discovery_fw_version = aiport4G.mt8390.v5.1.12.67.emu.260904.0000
device_id = fe6488e7-7042-5bcb-ab86-6f0ad1a5baed
guid = 5c2659d4-48f3-16c4-ed83-2fefbad37066
[network]
iface =
parent_iface =
mode = dhcp
ip =
netmask = 255.255.255.0
gateway =
dns =
[console]
host =
port = 7442
[logging]
debug = false
```

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `[console] host` | IP of the Protect console **you own**; the avclient dials it when not yet adopted. Blank by default. `port` default 7442. |
| `[identity] mac` | Empty derives a Ubiquiti-OUI MAC `FC:EC:DA:<iface last 3 octets>`. |
| `[identity] platform` | Must match the controller's catalog string. |
| `[identity] device_id` | Must be unique per emulated instance. |
| `[identity] fw_version` / `discovery_fw_version` | Short version over ucp4/avclient/http / longer L2 discovery string. |
| `[network] mode` | `dhcp` reads the live lease; `static` uses `ip`/`netmask`/`gateway`. `create --ip X.Y.Z.W` or `mode=static` makes `instance_manager.py` use `ip addr add` instead of `dhclient`. |
| `[network] iface` / `parent_iface` | Blank = auto-detect (default-route interface). |
| `[logging] debug` | Debug logs; any `--debug` overrides. |

## Install and run

One-shot installer (packages, venv, deps, model assets, `librknnrt` upgrade, systemd unit, web UI):

```bash
sudo scripts/install.sh --console <UNVR-IP> [--parent-iface <iface>]
```

Options: `--name NAME`, `--no-npu` (protocol stack only), `--rknn PATH`, `--rknn-url URL` /
`--rknn-sha256 HEX`, `--webui-port N`. Run as root. The manual equivalent:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install rknn-toolkit-lite2   # see "Object detection" below first

sudo python3 run_all.py --iface <your-iface> --fallback-host-port <console-ip>:7442
```

Identity and the console endpoint default from `aiport.cfg` -- edit it (or pass `--config`)
before the first run. Then adopt "AI Port" from the Protect UI like a normal camera, and pair a
real camera to it from the camera's own settings.

## Object detection (RK3588 NPU)

The pipeline runs a real quantized YOLOv5s model on the NPU. Model binaries are not committed;
fetch the assets (ONNX, anchors, COCO labels, calibration subset) and optionally build `.rknn`:

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_models.py            # download assets
python3 scripts/fetch_models.py --convert  # build .rknn (x86 host)
```

**Conversion must run on a separate x86_64 build host.** `rknn-toolkit-lite2` is the on-device,
inference-only API (aarch64-only wheels for Python <= 3.12); it can only run an already-converted
`.rknn`. Conversion needs full `rknn-toolkit2`, matching the on-Pi version. Two pins avoid known
environment bugs (`setuptools>=81` dropped `pkg_resources`; `onnx` 1.22.0 dropped `onnx.mapping`,
still used by `rknn-toolkit2`):

```bash
pip install "setuptools<81" "onnx==1.16.1"
pip install rknn-toolkit2==2.3.2
pip install onnx==1.16.1   # repin; rknn-toolkit2 may upgrade onnx
```

`fetch_models.py` places `yolov5s_relu.rknn`, `anchors_yolov5.txt`, and `coco_80_labels_list.txt`
in `models/` next to `detector.py`.

- **System `librknnrt.so` upgrade (required).** The stock OS ships runtime 1.4.0 (2022), which
  cannot load models built by `rknn-toolkit2==2.3.2` (`Invalid RKNN model version 6`). Replace
  `/usr/lib/librknnrt.so` with the v2.3.2 aarch64 runtime (back up the original, then `ldconfig`);
  `scripts/install.sh` does this. `RKNNLite().init_runtime()` should then log version 2.3.2.
- **Explicit batch dimension.** `RKNNLite.inference()` needs `frame[np.newaxis, ...]` (shape
  `(1,H,W,3)`) or it fails with `"need 4dims input, but 3dims input buffer feed"`. Handled in
  `detector.py`.

`avclient.py` runs one ffmpeg process per paired camera that pulls the RTSP stream and uses
`filter_complex split=2` for both outputs from a single decode: a 1/2-fps JPEG still (snapshots)
and 2-fps 640x640 raw RGB frames piped to Python for classification (no image-decode library
needed). A background loop classifies the latest frame every 1.5s (`MOTION_POLL_INTERVAL_S`): a
detection opens (`"enter"`) or refreshes (`"moving"`) a track, and a track closes (`"leave"`)
only after `MOTION_MISS_TOLERANCE_TICKS` (20, ~30s) of **consecutive** empty ticks. Simultaneous
objects are tracked independently and matched frame-to-frame by bounding-box IOU within each type.

Capability declaration is separate. For an event to be filterable by object type in the UI, the
camera's own `featureFlags.smartDetectTypes` / `hasMotionDetection` must be populated. This does
**not** come from `/api/1.2/status`; the real mechanism is the `EventFeatureFlagsUpdated` push
(above). The controller writes these into the AI Port's `featureFlagsMap` for the paired camera's
MAC and propagates the overridable subset on the next reconnect pass.

## Known limitations and next steps

- Live verification of multi-object tracking in a genuinely simultaneous different-type scene is
  still pending; only the single-object path has been re-confirmed live.
- Line Crossing support is implemented, but its event and capability shapes have not been tested
  against a live controller.
- The classifier is stock YOLOv5s (person/vehicle/animal), not Ubiquiti's second-pass classifier;
  real Ubiquiti weights are not portable to this NPU.
